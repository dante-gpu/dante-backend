providers:
  - name: 'Dante GPU Platform Dashboards' # A friendly name for the dashboard provider
    orgId: 1 # Default organization ID
    folder: 'Dante Platform' # Optional: The folder in Grafana UI where these dashboards will be placed
    folderUid: 'dante-platform-folder' # Optional: A unique ID for the folder
    type: file # Indicates that dashboards are loaded from files
    disableDeletion: false # Set to true to prevent users from deleting these dashboards from the UI
    editable: true # Set to false to prevent users from editing these dashboards from the UI (changes will be overwritten on next provision)
    options:
      # path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards # Path to the directory where dashboard JSON files are stored.
      # Grafana will look for this path inside the Grafana container.
      # In a Docker setup, this path is typically mounted as a volume.
      # Example: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards if GF_PATHS_PROVISIONING is /etc/grafana/provisioning
      # For our structure, we'll assume dashboards are in a subdirectory 'dashboards' relative to where Grafana expects provisioning files.
      # If GF_PATHS_PROVISIONING=/etc/grafana/provisioning, Grafana looks for this provider config in /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards,
      # and then the path here would be relative to that, or an absolute path.
      # Let's use an absolute path within the container for clarity, which will be mapped from our project.
      path: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dante-platform # Dashboards will be in a subfolder for better organization
